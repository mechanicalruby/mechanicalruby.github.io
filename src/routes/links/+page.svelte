<h2>Felix Waller</h2>

    I really enjoy the efficient simplicity of this site. I found him through the CSS JOY webring and his
    site really struck me with its sublimity. His site is an inspiration for mine. Love his posts.

<h2>Anders Jensen-Urstad</h2>
<p>
    Link: <a href="https://anders.unix.se/">anders.unix.se</a>
    <br>
    Simple but very sharp. Very Unix-like. It's a bit inactive writing-wise, but I like its contents
    even if it's old material. Also heavily inspired my site layout.
