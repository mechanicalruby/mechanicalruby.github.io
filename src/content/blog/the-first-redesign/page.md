title: The first redesign
date: Aug 25 2025

I finally spent the time I needed to bring my website up to my basic personal standards.
I wrote some stuff about myself here and there, added outbound links to some other
sites I like, and removed a lot of junk code!

Partially because I read [this](https://thoughts.melonking.net/thoughts/every-site-needs-a-links-page-why-linking-matters)
and I felt a little guilty about leaving my site in the state it was. But it still took a while.

The theming continues to be the hardest part for me. As a programmer, I highly value
simple, utilitarian design. But as a creative I also feel like my personal site shouldn't
be so cold and plain. At least now I have a clean base to build off of! Instead of junk!

Everything got a lot easier after I stopped trying to make everything huge for fat fingering on your phone.
Phones are pretty big these days, and even if they're small ... touching what you want is generally
pretty accurate. So I reverted to plain bullet lists, and more plain HTML in general.

I also took the time to read the PS Vita [browser spec](https://www.sie.com/content/dam/corporate/jp/guideline/PS_Vita_Web_Content-Guidelines_e.pdf),
so hopefully my site renders properly there. It's [CSS2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/propidx.html)
compliant, but I don't know if things like `flexbox` are added as the 'partial CSS3' support it mentions? So I'm avoiding that for now. I hope it works!
