Hello, world! I finally have my own website! And there's so much to do.

![yeah](./meta/computers.png)

# My own site!

I started working on this a while ago. I saw so many other people with awesome blogs, writing
about things they cared about- and I've always craved some sort of semi-public outlet for that type of thing, but I never took the time to make one. Now I have one!

I don't really know what I should discuss in my first blog post, so I'll just talk about myself and this website generally:

## Programming

I used [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) for this project. It's great for static sites, and I've really enjoyed how effective
Svelte is through its simplicity. I started working on a similar web project using Astro, but I quickly
found myself using Svelte exclusively for all the components and ... I just ended up switching
to SvelteKit because of some weird problems I had with Astro.

Programming the site was fairly straightforward, but I struggled with project management. I never realized how difficult it could be to get important tasks done without planning. So it took a couple of weeks for me to make time, and actually get everything to an acceptable state.

It's not perfect- there's some rough edges and some things I can improve. For example: I'll have to manually update every page when I author a new blog post. I know how to fix this, but I'm quickly learning it's best not to overcomplicate things until it's absolutely necessary.

I'm exploring project management systems in my free time, so that'll probably be what my next post is about. And the site should look a little different by then.

## Design

I think my visual design skills need some work...

I always thought I was *okay* as a graphic designer but apparently not. There's something wrong about the heirarchy or whatever. It feels a little off, despite being fairly minimal.

I'd love to give this site a more creative, asymmetric design with lots of stickers and a spacey background. But I'm not going to waste any more of my time editing the site. I'll do that LATER!

So ... I like the design for what it is. But it doesn't look *exactly* how I'd love it to look, so I'll take some time to personalize it in the future. I really don't want my *personal* website to end up looking soulless and basic for too long.

# Conclusion

So yeah, things are still pretty empty and unfinished around here right now. I made dark mode styles, but there's no button or autodetection yet. I have projects I want to show off, but they're not exactly in a state to *be* shown off yet.

I'm hoping this is the beginning of a productive and creative era for me. I spend so much time working on things that never blossom into tangible, finished products. And I can't wait to finally share more!
